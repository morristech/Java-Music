# Java-Music
Here resides a bunch of music related Java programs I'm making in my free time

**Music API** is another music-generating project which lets the user create music chord/collection objects and calculate
pitch[class] intervals easily. It also includes static collections of virtually every diatonic collection, pitch class, and pitch.

Here are a few examples.

        Pitch b3 = new Pitch(new PitchClass(PitchLetter.B, Accidental.NATURAL), Octave.THIRD);
        System.out.println(b3.transpose(Interval.M3).transpose(Interval.m3));  /* F#4 */
        
        PitchClass g = new PitchClass(PitchLetter.G, Accidental.NATURAL);
        DiatonicCollection gMinor = new DiatonicCollection(g, CollectionMode.MINOR);  /* [G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb, F] */
        DiatonicCollection gMajor = new DiatonicCollection(g, CollectionMode.MAJOR);  /* [G, A, B, C, D, E, F#] */
        
        PitchClass c = new PitchClass(PitchLetter.C, Accidental.NATURAL);
        Chord cMajor9th = new Chord(c, ChordType.MINOR, ChordSize.NINTH);  /* [C, Eb, G, Bb, D] */
        
        Pitch db4 = new Pitch(new PitchClass(PitchLetter.D, Accidental.FLAT), Octave.FOURTH);
        PitchedChord db4Major7th = new PitchedChord(db4, ChordType.MAJOR, ChordSize.SEVENTH);  /* [Db4, F4, Ab4, C5] */

**MusicStuff** is a project which generates all possible diatonic major/minor triads and major/minor scales. 
It outputs this to the console. The purpose of writing this project was to try and write something that is
a bit more maintainable and readable than how I did it for the other projects in this repo.


**ChordGenerator** uses the JavaFX toolkit to display a music quiz program. 
It randomly generates one of 480 potential key/chord combinations and displays this in musical
notation. The user is then expected to choose one of four choices to correctly analyze the
chord. Each is a Roman numeral signifying what scale degree the chord is built upon and 
Arabic numeral\(s\) to denote its inversion. This is a common activity in undergraduate music classes and my 
intention with writing this program was to assist students having difficulty with that concept.

In the **AndroidMusicQuiz** folder is an Android version of ChordGenerator. Here's a look at it on a
Google Nexus 5 emulator (Genymotion). It is published on the Google Play store and can be found here:

**SetTheoryCalculatorJavaFX** also uses JavaFX to display a music analysis tool used in
pitch-class set theory, a topic commonly taught to both undergraduate and graduate students at university.
A user enters a collection of pitch-classes and the program essentially
sorts these values in a variety of ways. The Normal Form sort, for instance, arranges the 
input into its most left-packed rotation (or right-packed, depending
on whether the Forte or Rahn algorithm is chosen, respectively).
