# Java-Music
Here resides a bunch of music related Java programs I'm making in my free time

**ChordGenerator** uses the JavaFX toolkit to display a music quiz program. 
It randomly generates one of 480 potential key/chord combinations and displays this in musical
notation. The user is then expected to choose one of four choices to correctly analyze the
chord. Each choice is a Roman numeral signifying what scale degree the chord is built upon and 
an Arabic numeral to denote its inversion. This is a common activity in undergraduate music classes and my 
intention with writing this program was to assist students having difficulty with that concept.
