Here resides a bunch of music related Java programs I'm making in my free time

**ChordGenerator** uses the JavaFX toolkit to display a music quiz program. 
It randomly generates one of 480 potential key/chord combinations and displays this in musical
notation. The user is then expected to choose one of four choices to correctly analyze the
chord. Each is a Roman numeral signifying what scale degree the chord is built upon and 
Arabic numeral\(s\) to denote its inversion. This is a common activity in undergraduate music classes and my 
intention with writing this program was to assist students having difficulty with that concept.

In the **AndroidMusicQuiz** folder is an Android version of ChordGenerator. Here's a look at it on a
Google Nexus 5 emulator (Genymotion). It is published on the Google Play store and can be found here:

**SetTheoryCalculatorJavaFX** also uses JavaFX to display a music analysis tool used in
pitch-class set theory, a topic commonly taught to both undergraduate and graduate students at university.
A user enters a collection of pitch-classes and the program essentially
sorts these values in a variety of ways. The Normal Form sort, for instance, arranges the 
input into its most left-packed rotation (or right-packed, depending
on whether the Forte or Rahn algorithm is chosen, respectively).
